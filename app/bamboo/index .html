                            <p>Gold is considered "safe haven" asset and potential ledge against inflation, deflation
                                and loosing it value as paper currencies.

                            <p>Gold is one of the very few investments that can be anonymous. If you choose, no one has
                                to know you own it. Virtually any other investment you may make does not have this

                    <p>Gold will always have value. <br>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>If you hold gold bullion, no paper contract is needed to make it whole. No middleman or other
                        party is necessary to fulfil a contractual obligation. That’s because gold is the only financial
                        asset that is not simultaneously some other entity’s liability.
                        <br><br>
                        This is important because gold will be the last man standing when bubbles pop or a crisis hits.
                        That’s a powerful tool to have in your portfolio when things start to go wrong in your country
                        or economy.

                    <p>
                        It also means gold won’t go to zero. It’s never happened in its 3,000+ year history. That’s a
                        powerful feature, especially if you asked former shareholders of companies like Bear Stearns,
                        Enron or Lehman Brothers.
