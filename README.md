# 1. ABOUT PROJECT BUNDLE

This bundle is created for fast Wordpress site configure and deployment. It is based on mix of Gulp & Webpack modules, which help to:

- compile SCSS/JS for different environments (development|production)
- optimize/resize static images and convert them to WebP
- convert TTF fonts to WOFF & WOFF2
- create/update/backup of DB between local, test & prod servers
- deploy of full app or theme (selective) between local, test & prod servers
- more features in process

We divided mobile and desktop src/build files for app assets, due to difference between mobile and desktop versions of app. This is controlled by PHP on backend for more adaptive and optimized frontend. In fact we have 2 different versions of app in the end, where each may contain independent UI & logic.

# 5. SETUP PROJECT
First of all create SSH key, name it *projectName*_rsa, save it in your \.ssh folder and send itâ€™s public version to your Admin

## Project naming

>>local project should be named *projectName*.loc due to environment check

after the whole setup, run Find&Replace command in your code editor and replace *projectName* with your actual project name for this files:
- package.json
- gulp/config.js
- /app/.htaccess-test

## Reinit git:

- run git init

# 6. WORDPRESS SETUP:

    - /app/local-config.php (for local and test env)
    - /app/config.php (for prod env)

- continue WP setup
- turn off *site indexing for search enfines*
- remove /app/ from site path in WP dashboard (WP will logout)
- goto http://*projectName*/admin and login again
- select Bamboo theme to start working with it
- remove app/.yeopress file
- configure /gulp/config.js

### *We use aggressive reduce of Wordpress functionality, such as disabling WP links from dashboard, quick drafts, comments, emoji's and other rarely used features, so in case of missing some of functionalty - don't panic: just take a look at /functions/tweak.php file in a theme folder.*

- run "gulp build" (build project for production)
- use gulp commands in /gulp/readme.md
